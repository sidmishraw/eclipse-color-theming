# Github color theme for Eclipse
##
## Author: Sidharth Mishra <sidmishraw@gmail.com>

This repository contains files for configuring the color theme for Eclipse and make it look similar to GitHub's.

To use the theme, there are 2 ways:

> Note: Please take a backup of your existing preferences before proceeding. For documentation, please refer this [article](https://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Ftimpandexp.htm)

* Download and install the [Eclipse Color Theme Plugin](http://www.eclipsecolorthemes.org/?view=plugin) and then import my GitHub theme to use it with Eclipse. (Recommended)

* Download my Eclipse Preference files (`.epf`) and import them into Eclipse directly to use the color themes. (Advanced, at your risk!)

The recommended theme file is [Sid#1_github_theme_eclipse.xml](./Sid#1_github_theme_eclipse.xml)

### For advanced Eclipse users:
You can download and use/modify the `.epf` files under the [to_be_used_without_eclipse_theme_plugin](./to_be_used_without_eclipse_theme_plugin) directory. 

## Please take a backup of your current preferences before proceeding!

### Tested with:
* Eclipse Mars, Neon and Oxygen. Cannot gurantee for other versions!
